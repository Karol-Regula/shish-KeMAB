This project allows the user to do what s/he has always wanted: see the real effect Donald Trump’s tweets have on our lives -- how they affect crime!
On our website we will display a graph that compares the number of tweets * (fancy maths) their sentiment and oomph to the frequency of different crimes committed in NYC in that time frame. User will be able to filter tweets by keyword, and crimes by type. User can also hover over a data point on the tweets’ bar graph and a popup of the text of the tweet will show up.

to run our program:

`$ pip install textblob`

Enjoy!
